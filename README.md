# Merge/Match Using Files Project

### Description

This project utilizes input and output files in python. The Match.py application compares input files and places the matched strings in an output file. The Merge.py application compares multiple input files and places all of the strings in an output file with NO repeating strings. 

### To Run

Using terminal on Mac,

```
$ cd Merge/Match-Using-Files
$ python ./Match.py
--------------THEN------------
$ python ./Merge.py
```

### Output

Match.py

- This program does not print anything to the screen. Instead it takes all the names in list1.txt and list2.txt finds the matching strings. Then places them into the results.txt file. 

Merge.py

- This program does not print anything to the screen. Instead it takes all the names in list1.txt through list8.txt, and merges all the strings together to place them into the results2.txt file.
